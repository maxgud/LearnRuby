#HOW TO DESIGN A PROGRAM
##################
#write your best description of your project
#highlight the nouns and verbs and how they relate to each
#other
#don't forget functiont trees and what not, draw them out

#Currently I am having a bit of an issue with the
#top down programming

#I actually really like the idea of compartmentalizing each
#aspect of the code and referring back to it just when I 
#need it.  It seems like that would have saved me a world
#of trouble while I was doing my adventure_quest game.

#Instead of having classes in that game I have a few classes
#just for the items bought and sold 
#And I have functions for everything else.

#I am going to think about this generally and maybe I will 
#get better at the top down programming better in the future

#but right now I am going to run with how I program.

#Maybe I could rewrite my Adventure quest with classes
#especially for monsters there are suppose to be 
# a lot of monsters and I just don't want a large 
#list of functions for monsters...  Well I would have 
#a large list of classes with functions in them for 
#monsters...
#I think this is where importing files comes in handy.
#If I could create a module that could be required 
#that has the monsters as a class, the class could be 
#a designator for what it is instead of just 
#monster_large or large_goblin or whatever...

#Lots to think about...  If I want to be a real programmer
#I need to be using this top down approach.  I think 
#it is easier to read and parallels a lot of other programming
#methodologies...

#I do stumble when there is a new object is defined with 
#a class.  I do get confused sometimes when that happens.
#Especially if a function is involved.  
#I understand that a function can be a subset of a class
#I also understand that you can define an object with a 
#function inside of a class.
#Maybe I don't understand how it is used.

#For Zed's program he knows that every room will have 
#an enter function.

#Parts of this I like, I should review it again.
#I like the idea of making my old game into classes.

#What the hell here I go.
